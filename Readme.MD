# Part 12: Full Stack App with Containers

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises for [part 12 - Containers](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part12) of the [Helsinki University Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course. The course focuses onteaching how to use containers for development and production applications. It is done through building full-stack web applications with React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

## Description

Part 12 of the course covers the use of containers in full-stack web development. The exercises in this part involve building a full-stack app using Docker. The main exercise app is a simple todo app that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
